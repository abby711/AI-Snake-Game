## AI-Snake-Game
The single-player variant of Snake is a well-known and popular video game that requires a player to navigate a line-based representation of a snake through a two-dimensional playing area, while avoiding collisions with the walls of the playing area and the body of the snake itself.
A score and the snake length are increased whenever the snake is moved through items representing food.



The game includes three path-searching-algorithm demos and one version of AI to play Snake automatically using Reinforcement Learning.
Implemented using both Greedy Algorithm and Hamiltonian cycle.

## OUTPUTS USING BOTH THE PATH SOLVERS ARE AS FOLLOWS:
Greedy Algorithm
